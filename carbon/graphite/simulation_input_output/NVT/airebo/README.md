## NVT simulation of graphite using the AIREBO potential

To run this simulation you need three files:
- `lammps_airebo_nvt.IN` - The lammps input script [here](lammps_airebo_nvt.IN).
- `lammps.lattice.dat`  - with the C mass defined as generated by the [lammps_gen_graphite_airebo.py](../../../scripts/lammps_gen_graphite_airebo.py) script from the [scripts](../../../scripts) folder.
- `CH.airebo` - from the lammps documentation or [here](../../../../potentials).

Run the simulation by calling lammps and directing the input and output accordingly:  
`lmp < lammps_airebo_nvt.IN > output.txt`

Replace `lmp` with the name of your executable for lammps.  The simulation should also work fine in parallel.  
`mpirun -n 4 lmp < lammps_airebo_nvt.IN > output.txt`

The simulation here is a simple NVT run of a graphite lattice for 10 ps. 
The initial structure is a periodic graphite cell consisting of  3x5x2 Unit cells, with ab stacking. The initial lattice `a` parameter is 2.4175 and initial `c` parameter is 3.358.

As the simulation progresses, running averages of the temperature and pressure are output to the file `Running_average.txt`.  The output frequencies can be configured in the lammps input script `lammps_airebo_nvt.IN`.
